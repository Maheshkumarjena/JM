## addItemModal.jsx

**Path**: [components/addItemModal.jsx](components/addItemModal.jsx)

**Quality**: 7

**Issues**: 3

**Suggestions**:
1. Consider using `useRef` for mutable objects like `DATA` instead of directly mutating it. This will help in maintaining the state correctly.
2. Use `async/await` consistently for asynchronous operations, especially in `getItemGroup` and `uploadItemList` functions to improve readability.
3. Implement error handling for the fetch requests to provide better user feedback.

2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling in the `getExcelData` function. Currently, it only logs the error to the console. Consider displaying a user-friendly message or a toast notification. 

3. **State Management**: The state management for `formData` can be improved. Consider using a reducer for better state management, especially since the form has many fields. 

4. **Magic Strings**: Avoid using magic strings like "Exempt", "DNM", etc. Define them as constants at the top of the file for better maintainability.
